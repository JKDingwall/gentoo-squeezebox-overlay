  logitechmediaserver-bin-7.7.2-r2.ebuild:
  Corrected LICENSE and RESTRICT

  License was inaccurately listed as GPL-2 (most, but not all, the contents of
  the package were GPL). Corrected this to the special EULA included with the
  package (this is included as a new license logitechmediaserver-bin in the
  overlay), and also added RESTICT of bindist and mirror to reflect the
  license's restrictions on redistribution of the binary package.

  See bug#450914.
